This is my final year project

Tech stack used--> React Native, Redux, and firebase.

Insperation/Idea--> During covid situations, we all got into problems of bad availability in hospitals, so I have created this app with the following features.

Features-->
          1. Check availability of beds in hospitals
          2. Check other required facilities inside the hospitals like overall rating of hospital, location, contact number, treatement types, etc.
          3. Contact numbers and address of doctors.
          4. Health tips using blogs and videos.
          5. Medicines usage info and disease treatment blogs.
          6. More features coming soon...
